# LAX1STCLIENT.JS
My 1st MPP modified client.js (INF NQ BY ME / LAG FIX GAVE BY WOLFY).
-----------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE:
INSTALL RESSOURCE OVERRIDE (NOT OPTIONAL) >> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/resource-override/pkoacgokdfckfpndoffpifphamojphii
-
OPEN THE EXTENSION
-
ADD TAB GROUP
-
YOU WILL NEED TO TYPE IN https://mppclone.com/*
-
ADD A NEW RULE WITH THE CHOOSEN URL > URL
-
TYPE IN script.js FOR MATCH URL AND https://pastbin.net/raw/lax1stclient-2 FOR REPLACE URL
-
MAKE SURE ITS ON AND ENJOY KILLING MPP :SKULL:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
TURN ON SETTING > MIDI > Output own notes to MIDI FOR LAG FIX

LAG FIX WILL KILL EVERY AUDIO PROCESS AND SO YOU NEED OMNI MIDI MADE BY KEPPY >> https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI
(USE IT AS OUTPUT)

WILL ONLY SEMI-WORK IN LOBBY BUT THE REST IS GOOD

<< ONLY A WORKING PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR NOW >>
<< BECAUSE I ONLY STARTED LEARNING JS >>
